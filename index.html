<p>Matt Spendlove is a director of Cenatus CIC where he leads on technical projects as web developer, contributes to creative projects with his experience as music producer, sound designer and label owner and co-organises the Netaudio Festival.</p>

<p>As an active music producer in the fields of UK dance music and leftfield electronica with a personal musical interest that covers everything from latest pirate radio sounds to the establishment electronic avant-garde, Matt chose to study electronic music and computer science at university. This lead to a career combining elements of these disciplines across a variety of creative projects as well as in his work as professional web developer.</p>

<p>Formalising this exposure to computer programming meant having the skills necessary to seize the opportunity for Internet music distribution by starting the Polymorphic online label in 2004. This platform promoted a variety of music and sonic art across a broad section of styles whilst utilising emerging internet technologies.</p>

<p>This naturally lead to an association with the Netaudio London Festival which he has been co-organising since 2006. Through working closely with Andi Studer (festival founder) on an event dedicated to promoting digital culture through new music, sonic and multimedia art and conference/workshop lead educational components, he has amalgamated his interests and gained valuable experience in cultural event production.</p>

<p>Matt acts as technical architect for Cenatus bringing in the wealth of experience gained whilst working as director of Radial Solutions, his previous web consultancy. Our in-house systems and client solutions are based largely around Ruby/Rails.</p>

<p>Matt can be found on Twitter, Github, Last.fm and Linkedin.</p>
