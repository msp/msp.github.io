{"name":"Msp.github.io","tagline":"msp on github","body":"### msp\r\n\r\nMatt Spendlove is a director of Cenatus CIC where he leads on technical projects as web developer, contributes to creative projects with his experience as music producer, sound designer and label owner and co-organises the Netaudio Festival.\r\n\r\nAs an active music producer in the fields of UK dance music and leftfield electronica with a personal musical interest that covers everything from latest pirate radio sounds to the establishment electronic avant-garde, Matt chose to study electronic music and computer science at university. This lead to a career combining elements of these disciplines across a variety of creative projects as well as in his work as professional web developer.\r\n\r\nFormalising this exposure to computer programming meant having the skills necessary to seize the opportunity for Internet music distribution by starting the Polymorphic online label in 2004. This platform promoted a variety of music and sonic art across a broad section of styles whilst utilising emerging internet technologies.\r\n\r\nThis naturally lead to an association with the Netaudio London Festival which he has been co-organising since 2006. Through working closely with Andi Studer (festival founder) on an event dedicated to promoting digital culture through new music, sonic and multimedia art and conference/workshop lead educational components, he has amalgamated his interests and gained valuable experience in cultural event production.\r\n\r\nMatt acts as technical architect for Cenatus bringing in the wealth of experience gained whilst working as director of Radial Solutions, his previous web consultancy. Our in-house systems and client solutions are based largely around Ruby/Rails.\r\n\r\nMatt can be found on Twitter, Github, Last.fm and Linkedin.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
